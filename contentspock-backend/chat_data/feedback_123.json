  "chatFeedback": "**ContentSpock**\n\nBased on the description provided about the issue with the SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application, where no products appear on the selector page despite attempts to add products and refresh the page, it indicates potential integration or configuration issues with the product catalog or synchronization problems.\n\nHere are the detailed steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Catalog Visibility:**\n   Ensure that the products are properly set to be visible in the marketplace. This involves verifying that the catalog versions are correctly configured to include the products and that these versions are marked as 'online'.\n\n2. **Synchronize Catalog:**\n   Execute a full catalog synchronization to ensure that all changes, including newly added products, are reflected across all necessary catalog versions. This can be performed in the SAP Commerce admin console:\n   - Navigate to the 'Catalog' section.\n   - Select the catalog in question.\n   - Click on 'Synchronize' and follow the prompts to execute a full synchronization.\n\n3. **Verify User Permissions:**\n   Confirm that the user account used to access the marketplace has the appropriate permissions to view the products. This may involve checking user roles and ensuring they include access to the catalog and products.\n\n4. **Check Product Data:**\n   Verify that the products added have all required fields properly filled, such as product name, price, and stock levels. Incomplete data can sometimes cause products not to display correctly.\n\n5. **Inspect Integration Settings:**\n   If the products are sourced from an external system or through an integration layer, check the integration settings for any errors or misconfigurations that might prevent the product data from being correctly imported into the SAP Commerce Cloud.\n\n6. **Review Application Logs:**\n   Examine the application logs for any errors or warnings related to product display, catalog synchronization, or user permissions. These logs can provide clues on what might be causing the products not to appear.\n\n7. **Test in a Sandbox Environment:**\n   If available, replicate the issue in a sandbox environment where you can safely make changes and test without affecting the live system. This can help isolate the issue by altering configurations, catalog data, or user permissions.\n\n8. **Consult Documentation and Support:**\n   If the issue persists, refer to the official SAP Commerce Cloud documentation for further insights into catalog management and product display issues. Alternatively, consider reaching out to SAP support for expert assistance.\n\nBy systematically checking these areas, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue causing products not to appear on the selector",
