  "audioFeedback": "Title: Troubleshooting Product Addition in SAP Commerce Cloud\n\nSummary: The audio discusses a user's technical issue with the SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application where products do not appear on the selector page despite attempts to add them. The user describes the problem, including symptoms and attempted solutions, without reaching a resolution.\n\nDescription: The speaker begins by outlining a persisting problem encountered while using the SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace applicationâ€”specifically, an issue when attempting to add products. Upon selecting the option to add products, the selector page that opens up lacks any visible products despite indicating that it's loading. The speaker repeatedly refreshes the page and retries adding products, but the issue persists throughout the recording. This ongoing problem leaves the user uncertain of the cause and possible solutions.\n\nLabel: Marketplace App",
  "videoFeedback": "**Title: Navigating the SAP Commerce Cloud with Contentstack**\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe video begins with the candidate opening a browser and accessing a specific URL associated with the Contentstack application. This URL is specifically linked to the SAP Commerce Cloud, suggesting the focus will be on this platform. The initial screen the candidate shares is titled \"Nida's Demo Stack\" and is part of the SAP Commerce Cloud branch. Here, the interface displays empty fields for adding a title, product, category, and tags. Each section is clearly labeled, indicating a user-friendly design. \n\nThe candidate then attempts to add a product by clicking a button labeled \"Add Product(s).\" The action shifts to a new interface within the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension. The screen is predominantly empty, presenting columns titled ID, Image, Product Name, Price, and Description. It is observed that data is not loading as expected, as indicated by repeated attempts to refresh the screen and a visible loading icon. Despite multiple refreshes, no product data is populated in the table, suggesting a potential issue with data retrieval or connection.\n\nThe screen sharing ends without the candidate successfully loading or adding any products. No proactive troubleshooting measures are evident beyond refreshing, which highlights a need for further technical intervention to resolve the loading issue.\n\nThroughout the demonstration, the interface remains clean and organized, reinforcing usability even in the midst of technical challenges. However, the inability to load the product details is a clear hindrance to completing the task.\n\n**Urgent Issues:** Product data fails to load after multiple refresh attempts.\n\n**Label:** [Blank] (The URL does not contain the term \"launch.\")"
