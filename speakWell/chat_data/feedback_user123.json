The session begins with the candidate accessing the 'Nida's Demo Stack' on Contentstack, selecting the SAP Commerce Cloud option, and preparing to manage product entries. Initially, the interface shows no products or categories added, prompting the user to add new entries. The candidate attempts to add products using the 'Add Product(s)' button. This action redirects to the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension page, intended to display product details such as ID, image, product name, price, and description. However, the table remains empty, indicating either a loading issue or absence of data. The candidate tries to refresh the page multiple times, but the interface continuously fails to fetch any product information. This ongoing refresh loop reflects a significant technical difficulty, hindering the completion of the demonstration. The video does not show any successful creation or publication of a product entry. Throughout, the URL displayed on the screen does not contain the term ‘launch.’ Therefore, it does not meet the conditions for a 'Launch' label. The demo video captures a straightforward yet obstructed attempt to illustrate product management on Contentstack integrated with SAP Commerce Cloud, repeatedly interrupted by loading and data retrieval failures.\",\n  \"title\": \"Contentstack and SAP Commerce Cloud Integration Demo\",\n  \"urgent_issues\": \"Repeated loading failures in the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension.\",\n  \"label\": \"\"\n}\n```",

  "chatFeedback": "**ContentSpock**\n\nGiven the specific issue described with the SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application where the product list fails to appear on the selector page despite multiple refreshes and attempts, here's a step-by-step solution appropriated towards this scenario:\n\n1. **Check User Permissions:**\n   - Verify if your user account has the appropriate permissions to view the products. You might need `catalog read` permissions. Contact your system administrator to ensure your user account has these permissions enabled.\n\n2. **Confirm Product Availability:**\n   - Ensure that there are products that have been correctly imported and are available in the system to be displayed. Sometimes, the product list might be empty due to backend inventory issues or synchronization problems.\n\n3. **Review Data Modeling:**\n   - Check if the products are correctly categorized and set up within the system. Incorrect data modeling might hinder the display of products on the marketplace application. This might require checking backend configurations related to product categories and catalog versions.\n\n4. **Examine Application Logs:**\n   - Look into the application logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what is going wrong during the product selection process. Search for errors related to database queries, permissions, or data fetching issues.\n\n5. **Cache and Session Data:**\n   - Clear the cache and session data of your browser or the application if possible. Sometimes, stale cache or session data can lead to issues in loading updated content like product lists.\n\n6. **Application Updates and Patches:**\n   - Ensure that your SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application is up to date with the latest patches and updates. Sometimes, issues are resolved in subsequent updates released by the software provider.\n\n7. **Contact Support:**\n   - If the issue persists, contact the SAP Commerce Cloud support team with detailed information and logs. They can provide more specific assistance and potentially identify a bug or a system-wide issue affecting the product selector page.\n\nImplementing these steps should help address the issue with the product selection process in your SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application.",
