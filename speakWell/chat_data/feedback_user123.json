The video begins with an overview of the Contentstack interface, demonstrating how to create new entries for products and categories in the Commerce Cloud module. The candidate shows how to input a title for new entries but does not add actual product details or categories at this stage. The interface allows the addition of products and categories; however, this functionality is not explored in depth in the current demonstration. Throughout the video, multiple views of the Contentstack's editing interface are shown, including options to save or publish entries. Moreover, an external SAP Commerce Cloud extension interface is opened, which appears to be waiting for products to load. The grid for displaying product information such as ID, image, name, price, and description remains empty during the recording. A key point of focus is the applicant's navigation between screens and how they manage interface elements. At one point, a pop-up prompts the user to reload the page to save changes, which is a crucial action in ensuring data integrity. The demonstration provides insights into the steps involved in setting up and managing content entries within these systems; however, it lacks comprehensive data manipulation or real-time examples. The session illustrates capabilities of the SAP Commerce Cloud interface but leaves room for more detailed exploration in future demonstrations.\",\n  \"urgentIssue\": \"No products or categories were added during the demo.\",\n  \"label\": \"\"\n}\n```",

  "chatFeedback": "### ContentSpock\n\nTo address the issue of not seeing products on the selector page in SAP Commerce Cloud, you should first verify your account permissions, as the visibility of products on this page is determined by user-specific access rights.\n\n1. **Check User Permissions:** Make sure your user account has the appropriate permissions to view and manage products in SAP Commerce Cloud. You may need to contact your system administrator to ensure that your user role includes permissions to access products on the selector page.\n\n2. **Confirm Product Availability:** Ensure that there are products actually listed and available within the system to appear on the selector page. There might be circumstances where no products are listed due to operational reasons or misconfigurations.\n\n3. **Review Configuration Settings:** Sometimes visibility issues can be related to configuration settings within SAP Commerce Cloud that restrict certain users or roles from accessing product data. These settings can be reviewed and adjusted by an administrator to ensure proper access.\n\nBy following these steps, the underlying access or visibility issues should be identified and resolved, allowing products to be displayed appropriately on the selector page in SAP Commerce Cloud."
