Initially, the candidate is on the Contentstack page, where they are required to enter a title for a new entry but do not type anything. They observe various sections like Product, Category, and Tags, which remain unpopulated. The candidate attempts to add products by clicking the 'Add Product(s)' button, which redirects them to the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension page. This page intended to show product listings is blank, and a loading symbol appears, but no content is rendered. The candidate reloads the page multiple times without success, and the loading issue persists. No products are added as the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension fails to retrieve or display the necessary data. The demo ends without successful product integration into the Contentstack platform. The video highlights potential problems with loading and displaying data from SAP Commerce Cloud via Contentstack, suggesting issues with integration or data retrieval that need addressing.\",\n  \"urgent_issues\": \"Loading issue with SAP Commerce Cloud Extension; no products display.\",\n  \"label\": \"\"\n}\n```",
