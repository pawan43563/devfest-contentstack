The user begins by creating a new entry under the 'SAP Commerce Cloud' content type. The screen shows fields for title, product, category, and tags, with options to add products and categories. However, none have been added yet. The user experiences a prompt asking if they want to reload the page, indicating potential unsaved changes. The interface reloads, and the user attempts to interact with the product section again. Following this, the user opens the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension. It appears to be an embedded interface aimed at selecting products, although currently void of items. The product extension showcases columns for ID, image, product name, price, and description, and the user attempts to refresh the interface multiple times without any visible changes. The prolonged loading and refreshing suggest potential connectivity or data retrieval issues. No entries or data appear processed throughout the demonstration, indicating a possible malfunction or need for troubleshooting on the server side.\",\n  \"title\": \"Navigating SAP Commerce Cloud in Contentstack: A Demo\",\n  \"urgent_issue\": \"Potential data retrieval or connectivity issues in the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension.\",\n  \"url_label\": \"\"\n}\n```",

  "chatFeedback": "**ContentSpock**\n\nTo solve the issue of the product selector page failing to display any products in the SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Check Application Logs:**\n   - Access the server where the SAP Commerce Cloud instance is hosted.\n   - Navigate to the logs directory, typically found under `{HYBRIS_HOME_DIR}/log`.\n   - Look for errors in the `console.log` or `error.log` files that correspond to the time the issue occurred. Errors related to database connectivity, product synchronization, or rendering issues might be causing the problem.\n\n2. **Verify Product Data Integration:**\n   - Open the HAC (Hybris Admin Console) by navigating to `https://{your-hybris-server}/hac`.\n   - Under the 'Console' tab, go to 'Scripting Languages' > 'FlexibleSearch'. Execute the following query to ensure that products are loaded in the database:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT {pk}, {code} FROM {Product} WHERE {catalogVersion} IN ({{SELECT {pk} FROM {CatalogVersion} WHERE {catalog.id}='yourProductCatalog' AND {version}='Online'}})\n     ```\n   - If the query returns no results, there is likely a synchronization issue or the products have not been imported properly.\n\n3. **Check ImpEx and Synchronization Status:**\n   - In the HAC, go to 'Console' > 'ImpEx Import'. Review the recent imports to check for any errors or warnings in product data imports.\n   - Navigate to 'System' > 'Catalog' > 'Synchronization', and ensure the catalog versions are properly synchronized. Trigger a new synchronization if necessary.\n\n4. **Inspect the Product Selector Component:**\n   - Check the customization or specific implementations for the product selector page.\n   - Review the source code or configuration (XML, Java, etc.) that loads products into the selector. Ensure queries and data paths are correctly set.\n   - Look for any condition or filter that might be preventing products from displaying, such as visibility restrictions or user-specific conditions.\n\n5. **Clear Cache and Test:**\n   - From the HAC, go to 'Monitoring' > 'Cache', and clear the cache.\n   - Also, consider clearing server cache or CDN cache if applicable.\n   - Refresh the Marketplace application and test the product selector page again.\n\n6. **Monitor Network Requests:**\n   - Open the browser's developer tools (F"
