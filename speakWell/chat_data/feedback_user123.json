The user clicks on the 'Add Product(s)' button, leading to a refresh request from the browser, but no products are added to the entry. This lack of visible data might suggest an issue with product retrieval or display. Throughout the demonstration, the user attempts to refresh the product list without success, indicating a possible technical issue or misconfiguration.

  "chatFeedback": "ContentSpock\n\nBased on the issue described regarding the SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application, it sounds like the user is encountering a permissions-related problem that prevents products from appearing on the selector page. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step solution to address this:\n\n1. **Verify User Permissions:**\n   - Ensure that the user account attempting to access the selector page has the necessary permissions to view the products. Check the user roles and rights to confirm that the account can view and manage products in the SAP Commerce Cloud.\n\n2. **Check User Groups and Catalog Versions:**\n   - Inspect whether the user belongs to the correct user groups that have access to the appropriate catalog versions. Products may be tied to specific catalogs, and viewing permissions can be restricted based on catalog versions and user groups.\n\n3. **Refresh User Permissions:**\n   - If any changes have been made to the permissions or user groups, ensure that these are updated in the system. Sometimes, logging out and logging back in can help refresh the permissions cache.\n\n4. **Consult the System Logs:**\n   - If the problem persists, check the system logs for any error messages or warnings that could provide more insight into why the products are not being displayed. Errors related to database access, API failures, or configuration mismatches may point towards the root cause.\n\n5. **Contact Support:**\n   - If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it may be necessary to contact SAP Commerce Cloud support for further assistance. Provide them with detailed information about the issue, including steps already taken, any relevant screenshots, and log entries.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue with the product selector page in the SAP Commerce Cloud Marketplace application."
