The demo begins with the candidate accessing a Contentstack dashboard, focusing on an SAP Commerce Cloud project. The dashboard is configured to add details for a new product including title, products, categories, and tags. The candidate navigates through an empty product section, with an option to add products, but no products are added during the demo. Similarly, the categories section is devoid of any entries, with an option to add categories. Throughout the demo, the candidate interacts with the fields available, emphasizing ease of use. During the demo, a prompt appears asking if the user wants to reload the page, as changes might not be saved. This could indicate an instability issue or server lag in the application. The candidate proceeds by demonstrating the SAP Commerce Cloud Extension. This part of the demo focuses on a product listing interface, which shows fields such as ID, image, product name, price, and description. The table remains empty during the demo, indicating no products are listed. The demo further suggests an option to 'Add 0 Product(s)' which might imply a placeholder feature not fully implemented or available during this session.
